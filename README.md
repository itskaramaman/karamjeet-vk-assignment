# BBC Web Scrapper

This project provides a Flask-based REST API that allows you to scrape and store news data from BBC News and BBC Sport, with functionality for retrieving stored news and sports articles with pagination. The API interacts with a SQLite database to store the scraped news items.

- **Database**: SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction)
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium WebDriver with Python
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Flask-CORS
- **WebDriver**: ChromeDriver (Headless mode)
- **Frontend**: React.js
